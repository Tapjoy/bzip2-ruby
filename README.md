# Ruby C bindings to libbzip2

This fork exists as the official release will not compile on Ruby 2.3.0. This gem has been pushed to
our GemFury account for use in projects that need it.

## Installation

First make sure youâ€™ve got Gemcutter in your sources list:

`gem sources -a http://gemcutter.org`

Then go ahead and install it as usual:

`sudo gem install bzip2-ruby`

You may need to specify:

`--with-bz2-dir=<include file directory for libbzip2>`

Or in a Gemfile

`gem 'bzip2-ruby'`

## Usage

The full documentation is hosted on [rdoc.info](http://rdoc.info/github/brianmario/bzip2-ruby/master/frames).

Here's a quick overview, hower:

``` ruby
require 'bzip2'

# Quick shortcuts
data = Bzip2.compress 'string'
Bzip2.uncompress data

# Creating a bz2 compressed file
writer = Bzip2::Writer.new File.open('file')
writer << 'data1'
writer.puts 'data2'
writer.print 'data3'
writer.printf '%s', 'data4'
writer.close

Bzip2::Writer.open('file'){ |f| f << data }

# Reading a bz2 compressed file
reader = Bzip2::Reader.new File.open('file')
reader.gets # => "data1data2\n"
reader.read # => 'data3data4'

reader.readline # => raises Bzip2::EOZError

Bzip2::Reader.open('file'){ |f| puts f.read }
```
